<h2>Forum Issues</h2>
<p>
We&#39;re currently dealing with some malicious activity on the forum.&nbsp; Some of the developers have decided to lock it until the problem is fixed.&nbsp; Quite frankly, it&#39;s disappointing that we need to go this far, but we the development team will ban and kick people who refuse to behave or cause problems for us.&nbsp;

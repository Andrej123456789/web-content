Probably yes. However we highly recommend to check first if your favourite app runs in ReactOS. 
ReactOS is still an on-going project and not all the apps and drivers runs perfect on it. 
The best way to check the compatibility is to install ReactOS inside a virtual machine ( a step by step and video guide can be found here) and try your own needs. 
There are tons of pieces of software and, as you may imagine, is impossible to track all of them.

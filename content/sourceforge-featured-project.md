<p>The ReactOS Project is proud to have been selected as a SourceForge.net Featured Project for the month of February. While ReactOS maintains much of the development infrastructure internally now, SourceForge remains the host for all of our releases and helps provide another web presence for the project. Based on the stats, getting bumped to SourceForge's front page has drawn a fair amount of attention to the project.</p>

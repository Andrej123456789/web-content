A pity you're not a Developer. But ey! ReactOS needs more skills than just Devs. We're always seeking for real testers. Yeah, becoming a REAL tester is not easy, but it's funny. Also for designers to enhance our iconsets, create resources for the website or events where ReactOS is shown. Writers willing to create a small snip of text to share the latest ReactOS enhancements. Translators for our website and the operating system itself. Or even Donors, who helps us to pay our server bills.

<h2>Server maintenance</h2>

<p>Our scheduled server maintenance started about a week ago. It went rarther smooth, with exception to all mail-related services. We're working on fixing email-related issues and beg our pardon for the inconvinience. Please have in mind that right now ALL email services may not work. This includes registration on the website, forum notifications, mailing lists, @reactos.org email aliases, etc.</p>

<p>The mailing system will be restored as soon as possible</p>

<h2>Announcement: ReactOS Interviews series</h2>
<p>We are starting a <a href="[#link_interviews]">series of interviews</a> with ReactOS developers. The <a href="[#link_interview_1]">first interview</a> features our project coordinator <a href="[#link_interview_1]">Aleksey Bragin</a>. </p>
<p>Interviews are divided into several parts and&nbsp;cover different interesting topics - beginning from how&nbsp;developers got involved&nbsp;in the ReactOS project and going up to which development software they use in their daily work.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;are going to publish&nbsp;interviews on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't forget to read the second news of today, a <a href="[#link_news_page_26]">request for a &quot;ReactOS Weekly Newsletter&quot; author</a>.</p>

<p>You can help translating in at least two different ways. The first one is helping to translate this website (for now it is just in English), the second one is helping to translate the operating system. Here you can find a guide about how to request a position to translate the site, and here an awesome tool created by XXXX which helps you to find which files are needed to be translated.</p>
